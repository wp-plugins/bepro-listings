= WHATS THE DIFFERENCE? =

We created BePro Listings and its addons to be *modular*. In addition, our templates are very dynamic. This combination creates a platform for creating any type of directory. For example, with our form builder addon, you can create a **real Classifieds website** featuring multiple directories simultaneously.

Out of the box, BePro Listings works with buddypress, BePro Cart, BePro Email and many **gallery plugins**. Via paid addons, we also integrate with s2member, paid membership pro, and several other popular plugins. This open and inclusive architecture, makes it extreamly easy to add the best combinations of features for your **directory** / **classifieds** / **portfolio** / **Catalogue** site. 

Most importantly, BePro Listings is built for various levels of users. Novice users will appreciate our $1 themes, **ajax features** and *"all in one"* shortcodes. Intermediate users will like the plethora of, configuration options, widgets and extra shortcodes. Also we didn't forget developers and advanced users with our long list of wordpress hooks and filters.

= SHORTCODES =
These all have options and you can check them out via the documentation link above.

	* All In One (NEW) - Use one shortcode to implement several features at once. Various configurations available [bl_all_in_one].
	* Google Map - Setup a map anywhere showing the last listings on your site e.g. [generate_map]
	* Basic Search - Allow users to search listings e.g. [search_form]
	* Filter Search Table - Allow users to do a more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [filter_form]
	* Filter Search CSS - Allow users to do more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [bl_search_filter]
	* Listings - Show listings with optional paging e.g. [display_listings]
	* Front end Upload Form - Give your users the ability to submit from any page or post. You can set a default user id for the listing or force registration. e.g. [create_listing_form]
	* Category Links - Allow users to navigate your directory/listings using category links e.g. [display_listing_categories]
	* Profile - Use our standalone profile shortcode, no need for buddypress or any other plugin [bl_my_listings]

= TROUBLE SHOOTING =

* 404 Error - If Listing pages produce a 404 error, try resetting your permalink settings in the admin. Simply re-save your current settings, so that they are reset for all urls. The option is under your settings menu.

* Google Maps - If google map controls look weird, this is a css style related issue (your theme). Specifically, its the addition of max-width declarations to images. For details, you can *google* the issue (**google maps** max-width). Lots of bootstrap themes use this css declaration.

* Displaced sidebar - If the details page has a displaced sidebar i.e. obviously broken template, you will need to create one for BePro Listings. Details about how to do that are included in the documentation link above. Every plugin which creates pages from custom post types, has this issue and requires its own template file.

== Other Notes ==

BePro Listings is the most advanced Direcotory and front end upload plugin available. Its dynamic architecture and configuration options facilitate unique and feature filled solutions. This allows BePro Listings to transform into any type of directory. In fact, you can run multiple directories simultaneously via multisite for FREE, or on one domain with our Form Builder addon.

Our **Drag and Drop Form Builder** addon is unique and takes advantage of our advanced architecture. It truely allows you to **Visually build** custom directories in whatever language you need. The typical issue with form builders is how they store information. It makes it impossible to search anything more than the title. With the BePro Listings approach, we are light years ahead of any other form builder or directory. BePro Listings store's the information in different ways, exposing many aspects to search and filter. What we are offering is unique, it can scale to millions of listings and you **cannot find this solution** anywhere else.

The base free plugin is filled with features used in most, directory, classifieds and portfolio websites. Our addons facilitate tons of added features that are only applicable to a subset of users e.g. Real Estate agents, Car Dealers, etc. With this level of control, there is no limit to the type of listing website you can create.  

Many of what we give away for free, others will charge you for e.g. clusterd google maps and csv import. Also note our optional payment and notification features. You will need to download the free plugins BePro Cart and BePro Email to implement these features. We invite you to start **making money** today and take advantage of what we consider to be the most **advanced email notification plugin** available. These addons continue our trend of offering you a flexible way to build the directory experience that your users require.
