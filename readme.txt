= THEMES =

BePro Listings has spawned the famous **$1 one dollar wordpress themes**. Some of our $1 one dollar wordpress themes are **complete themes**, while others are **child themes** built on free solutions. We want to prove that you can integrate BePro Listings into any theme and create any type of listings site. **CHALLENGE US!** 

	1. ByCater - This responsive directory theme features a home page template utilizing (google map, search, categories, and listings). It also integrates with typical wordpress features like, sidebar, menu, etc
	2. FolioProjects - Responsive Child theme for the stock wordpress twentyfourteen teamplate. Perfect for gallery, portfolio, and other sites where you want to emphasize the featured images. Comes with three templates

	5. MP Directory - Try this theme for your next, real estate, vehicle, or other directory

= WHATS THE DIFFERENCE? =

We created BePro Listings and its addons to be *modular*. In addition, our templates are very dynamic. This combination creates a platform for creating any type of directory. For example, with addons you can create a **real Classifieds website** featuring multiple directories simultaneously.

Out of the box, BePro Listings works with buddypress, cubepoints and many **gallery plugins**. Via addons, we also integrate with s2member, paid membership pro, and several other popular plugins. This open and inclusive architecture, makes it extreamly easy to add the best combinations of features for your **directory** / **classifieds** / **portfolio** / **Catalogue** site. 

Most importantly, BePro Listings is built for various levels of users. Novice users will appreciate our $1 themes, **ajax features** and *"all in one"* shortcodes. Intermediate users will like the plethora of, configuration options, widgets and extra shortcodes. Also we didn't forget developers and advanced users with our long list of wordpress hooks and filters.

= SHORTCODES =
These all have options and you can check them out via the documentation link above.

	* Dynamic Map - Setup a map anywhere showing the last listings on your site e.g. [generate_map]
	* Basic Search - Allow users to search listings e.g. [search_form]
	* Filter Search Table - Allow users to do a more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [filter_form]
	* Filter Search CSS - Allow users to do more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [bl_search_filter]
	* Listings - Show listings with optional paging e.g. [display_listings]
	* Front end Upload Form - Give your users the ability to submit from any page or post. You can set a default user id for the listing or force registration. e.g. [create_listing_form]
	* Category Links - Allow users to navigate your directory/listings using category links e.g. [display_listing_categories]
	* All In One (NEW) - Use one shortcode to implement several features at once. Various configurations available [bl_all_in_one].
	* Profile - Use our standalone profile shortcode, no need for buddypress or any other plugin [bl_my_listings]

= TROUBLE SHOOTING =

* 404 Error - If Listing pages produce a 404 error, try resetting your permalink settings in the admin. Simply re-save your current settings, so that they are reset for all urls. The option is under your settings menu.

* Google Maps - If google map controls look weird, this is a css style related issue (your theme). Specifically, its the addition of max-width declarations to images. For details, you can *google* the issue (**google maps** max-width). Lots of bootstrap themes use this css declaration.

* Displaced sidebar - If the details page has a displaced sidebar i.e. obviously broken template, you will need to create one for BePro Listings. Details about how to do that are included in the documentation link above. Every plugin which creates pages from custom post types, has this issue and requires its own template file.
